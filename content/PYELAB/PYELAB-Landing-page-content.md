Section 2: The Hook (The "Why")
Headline: You’ve built a seat at a table you don’t own.
Body Copy:
You are the engine. You are the "fixer." You are the one who ensures the targets are met and the systems stay standing. You’ve spent years mastering the corporate game, but as we stand at the start of a new year, the most important question isn’t how much more you can give them—it’s how you intend to reclaim what belongs to you.
Whether your "Exit Date" is in 60 days or 24 months, a transition of this magnitude requires more than a resignation letter. It requires a Blueprint.
Welcome to The PyeLab. In this 5-day intensive, we treat your career and your future business like a science. We aren't just "dreaming" about freedom; we are engineering it with precision.

Section 3: The Framework (5-Day Curriculum)
Headline: The 5-Day Curriculum: From Asset to CEO.
Day 1: The Audit (Time Alchemy)
The Goal: Stop being "time-poor" for the sake of others.

Day 2: The Freedom Number (The QUIT Formular)
The Goal: Fear lives in vague numbers; confidence lives in the calculator.
Day 3: The One Offer (Yield Analysis)
The Goal: High-achievers over-complicate.
Day 4: The CEO Bridge (Pressure Testing)
The Goal: De-risk your jump.
Day 5: The EXIT Blueprint (The Contract)
The Goal: Assemble the slices: a written Exit Blueprint—a strategic timeline and a signed contract with yourself to officially move from corporate asset to CEO.

Section 5: About Your Exit Coach
Image: Professional headshot or the "Boardroom" image from the flyer.
Copy:
"Leadership is not just about how you show up at work; it’s about how you show up for yourself. You’ve been the engine for everyone else’s machine for long enough. It’s time to build your own. I’ll see you in the Lab." — [Your Name]

Section 6: Footer/FAQ
When does the Lab meet? Daily at 12 PM ET / 9 AM PT from Jan 26–30.
What if I can't attend live? VIP and Executive tiers receive lifetime replays. General Admission has 7-day access.
Is this for me if I'm already in business? Yes. If your business feels like a job you can't leave, we are going to slice it up and re-engineer it for yield and freedom.

Developer Notes (For the Tech Setup):
Order Bump: On the $47 checkout page, include a small checkbox: "Wait! Add the 'Bo$$ Resignation Vault' and Lifetime Replays for just $97 more? [Yes/No]"
Tracking: Ensure Facebook/Google pixels are set up on the "Thank You" page to track "Lead" vs. "Purchase" values.
Mobile Optimization: Ensure the pricing table stacks vertically on mobile devices for ease of use.
"Welcome Email" 
that triggers the moment they choose their tier
This automated welcome email is designed to be the first "touchpoint" of your brand. 
Subject: Welcome to the Lab: Your Journey to CEO Starts Now.
Dear [Name],
You’ve officially claimed your slice.
By registering for The PYELAB, you’ve made a strategic decision to stop being a donation to someone else’s dream and start becoming the architect of your own.
High-achieving women like you don't just "quit"—we exit with precision, grace, and a blueprint that ensures our next move is our best move. I am honored to be in the Lab with you as you engineer this transition.
The Logistics: Mark Your Calendar
Dates: January 26 – 30, 2026
Time: 12:00 PM ET | 9:00 AM PT
Where: [Insert Link to Private Community or Zoom Room]
Your Tier: [General / VIP / Executive]
What to Expect
We start live on Monday, January 26th. There is nothing for you to do right now except protect those 60 minutes on your calendar. In the Lab, we move fast and we move with purpose.
I’ll be sending the PyeLab Digital Workbook to your inbox on the morning of Day 1. We will open it together and start the work live.
A Note on Your Vision
Between now and our start date, I want you to simply notice where your excellence is being under-utilized or over-leveraged by others. You don't need to change anything yet—just observe. We’ll address all of it when the Lab doors open.
If you are in the VIP or Executive tiers, keep an eye out for a separate email containing your private access links for our daily Hot Seat coaching sessions.
You have the talent. Now, let’s build the command.
I’ll see you in the Lab.
With vision and strategy,
[Your Name]
